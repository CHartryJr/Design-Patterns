Derek Banas - flyweight Design Pattern
The flyweight design pattern is used to dramatically increase the speed of your code when you are using many similar objects.
To reduce memory usage the flyweight design pattern shares Objects that are the same rather than creating new ones.

There are two states that effects memory the Intrinsic State: Color and Extrinsict State: size.
