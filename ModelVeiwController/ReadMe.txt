Derek Banas - Model Veiw Controller

To understand the Model View Controller you just need to know that it separates the Calculations and Data from the interface.
 The Model is the class that contains the data and the methods needed to use the data. The View is the interface.
 The Controller coordinates interactions between the Model and View.
