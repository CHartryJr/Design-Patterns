Derek Banas - Composite Design Pattern

The composite pattern also allows you to treat both groups of parts in the same way 
as you treat the parts polymorphically. This allows your objects to maximize complexity while also remaining dynamic.
Represeting part-whole herarchies as componets that can be further broken down into smaller groups.
