Derek Banas - Bridge Design Pattern

This pattern is useed to decouple a abstrction from it's implementation
progressivly adding functionality while separationg out major diffrences using abstraction
This Pattern is used when you want to be able to change both the abstractions and concrete claesses
independantly, when you want the first abstrcat clas to define rules 
down side abstract classes defines the abstract methods are required
