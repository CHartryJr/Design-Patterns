Derek Banas - Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

This pattern has a group of objects that are expected to between them be able to solve a problem. 
If the first Object canâ€™t solve it, it passes the data to the next Object in the chain. 
In this tutorial, use it to make the right calculations based off of a String request.
