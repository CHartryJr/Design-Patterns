Derek Banas - Mediator Design Pattern

All communication is handled by a Mediator Object and the Colleagues donâ€™t need to know anything about each other to work together.
The Gang of Four description: Allows loose coupling by encapsulating the way disparate sets of objects interact and communicate with each other. 
 Allows for the actions of each object set to vary independently of one another.
