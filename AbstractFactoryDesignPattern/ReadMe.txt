Derek Banas - Abstract Factory Design Pattern
This Design Pattern is simualar to the standard factory Design Pattern with 
the difference being everything is encapsulated
Methods that order the object 
factories that build the objecy and every object is final.
these final objects use the StrategyDesignPattern
allows you to create families of related objects without specifiying a concrete class 
you can dynamically change objcects  and model anything you want and have them interact through common
interfaces
downside things can get very complicated.
Other look on this design pattern:
The classes variable to a object are abstract objects that is then used to create the executable object
