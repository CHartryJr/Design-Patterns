Derek Banas - Factory Design Pattern
The Factory Design Pattern  uses a tactic to better organize polymorphism use cases. The factory class
uses a method that returns one of serveral possible classes that share a common super class.
the classes are choosen at run time.
The Factory pattern is used when you don't know ahead of time what class object you need and all 
potential classes uses the same subclass hierarchy.
