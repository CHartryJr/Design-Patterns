Derek Banas - Strategy Design Pattern

This design pattern is used to remeove the issue of bulkiness in code and breaking oop structures by 
making it easier to refactor behaviors with in a object hierarchy.
Behaviors should be seperated from the class(es) and represented by one instance allowing
dynamic change of the behaviors. This tactic is also know as compositioning. The negative of this
design is the creation of many files and structures.
