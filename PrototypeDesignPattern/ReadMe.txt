Derek Banas-PrototypeDesignPattern

The Prototype design pattern creates new objcects by clonning other objects
allows foe adding of any subclases of a known superclass when there are 
numerous potential classes that you want to only use at runtime
reduce the need for subclasses
The Prototype design pattern is a creational pattern that uses a prototype to create new objects by copying this prototype.
In other words, instead of creating new objects, we clone them from the prototype.
The pattern is used when object creation is resource expensive. By cloning new objects, we avoid the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way.
Mitotic cell division, which results in two identical cells, is an example of the Prototype pattern. 
When a cell splits, two cells of identical genotype result. In other words, the cell clones itself.
